[![Build
Status](https://travis-ci.org/nschloe/hbio.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nschloe/hbio)

This is fork of the original (now unmaintained) Harwell-Boeing File I/O in C
<http://math.nist.gov/~KRemington/harwell_io/README.html>.

Goals of the fork are to allow for building and linking against HBIO by
providing an actual library, bringing it up to speed with recent compilers,
and getting a better modern system in place. On top of that, the code is now
version-controlled on GitHub, integration tests are to be implemented.
